            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.<br>
            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, <br>
            Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.<br>
            A day on Earth is 24 hours. Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days<br>
            Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients—the perfect balance to breathe and live. <br>
            Earth also has one moon and it has no rings.Our atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface.<br>
