                Jupiter is the fifth planet and it's the largest one (like massive!) and it's the first one in the outer planets <br>
                and it's a gaseous planet which means that it's all made out of gas not rocks like other planets. Galileo Galilei<br>
                was the first to discover its moons. Jupiter has swirls and stripes which are actually cold , it has clouds of ammonia<br>
                and water in an atmosphere ofhydrogen and helium, it has a big spot called The Great Red Spot but in fact it's not just a normal<br>
                spot it's actually a huge storm bigger than earth itself that has raged for hundreds of years. It takes about 10 hours to make one<br>
                orbit around itself and about 12 earth years to make one orbit around itself. Jupiter os mostly made up of helium and hydrogen<br>
                ,jupiter also has a faint thin ring around it and it has more than 75 moons and some of them have water so it might be sutible for life!
