        <p>
            Venus is the second planet to the sun and it's the closest to earth and it's also one of the inner planets, it's also the hottest one of all the planets <br>
            It's also called earth's twin since they are simmilar in size and density but they aren't identical, Venus has a thick atmosphere <br>
            that contains co<sub>2</sub> and has yellowish thick clouds made of sulfuic acid that traps all the heat that comes to it <br>
            that's why it's hotter than mercury even though mercury is closer to the sun and the tempretures on venus reach 475 degrees celsius.<br>
            Venus also has a very high air pressure 90 times more than earth's. It also rotates on its axis backwards ,so the sun rises from <br>
            the west and sets at the east oppisite to earth. Venus also rotates slowly on its axis so the days on it are very long and it lasts <br>
            243 earth days but it orbits around the sun faster than earth and it takes 225 earth days to make one complete rotation!
