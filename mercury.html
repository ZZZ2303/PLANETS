       <p> Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest planet to the sun and it's one of the inner planets, although it the closest to the sun but it isnt the hottest <br>
        Venus the second planet is.<br><br>
        Mercury is a rocky planet which means it has a rocky surface or that it's made of rocks it also has no rings around it,<br><br>
        its also almost as big as the earth's moon, it also doesnt have any moons.
        It would also be very hard to live there because of the radiations that hit it since its very close to the sun.<br><br>
        Its rotaion around itself is very slow compared to earth ,so it takes about 59 earth days to make one full rotaion around itself.<br><br>
        But since it's the closest to the sun so it makes one full rotaion around the sun in only 88 earth days!<br><br>
        Also since the mercury is very close to the sun so the sun would look more than three times larger than what we see on earth!</p>
