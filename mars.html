            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet to the sun and it's the last one of the inner planets which is a cold ,dusty, desert <br>
                with a very thin atmosphere, Mars is also smaller than earth, Its days are a little longer than earth days (24 hours)<br>
                but it takes 687 earth days to take a full orbit around the sun. It's also a rocky planet full with volcanoes, winds ,and <br>
                chemical reactions, the atmosphere contains co<sub>2</sub> ,argon, nitrogen, and a small amount of oxygen and water vapour.<br>
                Mars also has no rings but it has two moons named <strong>Phobos and Deimos</strong>.It's called the red planet because its <br>
                soil contains iron minerals causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.
