                Uranus is the seventh planet in the solar system and it's the third planet in the outer planets and it's the third <br>
                largest planet in the solar system. It rotates at a nearly 90 degree angle so it looks like it orbits on its side and it rotates from east to west.<br>
                It takes about 17 hours to orbit around itself and about 84 earth years to make a full orbit around the sun.<br>
                Uranus is made up of dense 'icy'materials which are water, ammonia and methane all that on top of a rocky core, <br>
                and the methane in it is what gives it its icy  blue color, and its atmosphere is made up of helium and hydrogen and some methane.It has 13 rings around it and it has 27 moons.
